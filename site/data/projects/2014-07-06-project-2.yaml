description: Wahzu Wahzu sees the Parlor stoking their campfire into a forest-scorching disco inferno, staking out their dancefloor on backwoods dirt and using the stars above as their LED rig. Wahzu Wahzu manages to achieve what most albums can’t these days, which is an actual opus of work that tells a story; twelve tracks that flow in and out of one another, all distinct yet seamlessly familial and integral. These days full-lengths tend to feel necessarily disaggregated in the era of the single, and the music industry’s compulsive obsession with the track-by-track release. Wahzu Wahzu defies this convention entirely.
