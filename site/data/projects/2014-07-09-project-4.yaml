description: Our Day in the Sun chronicles the adventures of the authors through their traumatic trip from land to sea and back; from the obsessive mantras of grabbing for a dream to the restorative mantras of the post-grievous. It is based on a true story of ambition, demise and redemption told in musical vignette.
